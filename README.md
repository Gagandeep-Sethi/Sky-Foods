# this code was written for the sole purpose of learning thats why it is not completely made with every feature of food ordering app but i am still pushing it on github so that if i needed to revise that topic i can 

here we can write everything we need to tell others about project what it contains if they have any problem they can solve their confusion

#2 types of routing 
server side routing ---when a network request is made to the server and server bring back request like html page etc

Higher order functions are those that takes function as their arguments and returns new modified funtion like in this app high rated label is added to those who have hugh ratings and rest are shown as it is with help of HOF their is no need to write sepearte whole big code for it we can add modification in restraunt card and return it
# redux






# testing 
first two are more for dev 
and we do while switching again and again b/w browser and code is manual testing
=>unit testing (testing don for one component in isolation is known as unit testing)
=>integration testing()
=>end to end testing e2e needed many software for this it is detailed testing it simulates the whole environment right from a user enters on site his action performed till he leaves the site
coverage folder is made by test to tell how much area is covered so no need to commit it on git so we can it in .gitingore
